Get gifs from your favorite television shows at the click of a button! :tv:

## What this project does ## 

This project makes use of the [`GIPHY API`](https://developers.giphy.com/) to access GIPHY's enormous gif library. `jQuery` is used to display gifs in the `DOM`. Buttons are created with a `for loop`, gifs and their static images are toggled with an `if-statement`, and user input is collected with `on-click functions`.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

1. **[Open GifTastic](https://fkakatie.github.io/giftastic/)**.
    - Suggested television show titles appear on the left-hand side of the page. You can even add your own!

2. **Load some gifs**.
    - At the touch of a button, 10 images from the GIPHY library will load on the page. 

3. **Animate the gifs**.
    - Click any still image to animate the gif! Pause the gif by clicking again.
